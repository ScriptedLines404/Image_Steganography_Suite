# Image Steganography Suite

A collection of secure steganography tools that hide secret messages in images using different encryption methods. This project demonstrates three approaches to embedding encrypted data in images while preserving visual quality.

üîê **Supported Techniques**:
1. **Basic XOR Steganography** - Simple LSB embedding with XOR cipher
2. **Enhanced XOR Steganography** - Improved pixel traversal pattern
3. **AES-Encrypted Steganography** - Military-grade encryption before embedding

## üöÄ Project Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Data Hiding**: Conceal messages in image pixels using LSB techniques
- **Multiple Encryption Options**:
  - XOR cipher (basic and enhanced versions)
  - AES-256 with SHA-256 key derivation (most secure)
- **Image Support**: Works with common formats (JPEG, PNG)
- **Visual Preservation**: Maintains original image appearance
- **Key Protection**: Requires secret key for decryption

### Technical Specifications
1. **Basic XOR Version**:
   - Simple character-wise XOR encryption
   - Sequential pixel embedding
   - Supports custom or random images

2. **Enhanced XOR Version**:
   - Improved 3D pixel traversal (row‚Üícolumn‚Üíchannel)
   - Better resistance to basic detection
   - Visual comparison of original/encoded images

3. **AES Version**:
   - AES-256 in CBC mode with random IV
   - SHA-256 key derivation
   - PKCS#7 padding
   - Full encryption before embedding
